# Feature Specification: What Are We Watching (WRWW) - Movie/TV Show Voting Leaderboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2024-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a movie/tv show application call \"What Are We Watching\" (wrww). The premise of the the app will be a leader board for the categories of movies and tv shows. The users will not have to login but can come in and swipe right or left or up. Right means they +1, left means they -1 and up means havent seen it or 0. this will build our leader board. the texh stack will be next.js with supabase. You will use https://github.com/sudeepmahato16/movie-app as an example of how to get movie info and sturcture the styling."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a movie/TV show enthusiast, I want to quickly vote on content I've seen or haven't seen, so that I can contribute to community rankings and discover what's popular without needing to create an account or log in.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the application for the first time, **When** they land on the homepage, **Then** they see a swipeable card interface with movie/TV show content ready for voting
2. **Given** a user is viewing a movie/TV show card, **When** they swipe right, **Then** the vote count increases by +1 and the next card appears
3. **Given** a user is viewing a movie/TV show card, **When** they swipe left, **Then** the vote count decreases by -1 and the next card appears
4. **Given** a user is viewing a movie/TV show card, **When** they swipe up, **Then** the card is marked as "haven't seen" (0 vote) and the next card appears
5. **Given** a user has voted on content, **When** they navigate to the leaderboard, **Then** they see ranked lists showing top-voted movies and TV shows by category
6. **Given** a user is browsing the leaderboard, **When** they select a category filter, **Then** the leaderboard updates to show only content from that category

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to vote on the same content multiple times in one session?
- How does the system handle voting when there's no network connection?
- What happens when all available content in a category has been voted on?
- How does the application handle simultaneous votes from multiple users on the same content?
- What happens when movie/TV show data is unavailable or incomplete?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to vote on movies and TV shows without requiring authentication
- **FR-002**: System MUST support three voting actions: positive (+1), negative (-1), and haven't seen (0)
- **FR-003**: System MUST display content in a swipeable card interface
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to view real-time leaderboards showing aggregated vote rankings
- **FR-005**: System MUST organize content into categories for both movies and TV shows
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent duplicate votes from the same user session on the same content
- **FR-007**: Leaderboards MUST update when the page is requested, showing the current top 10 movies and TV shows from the database
- **FR-008**: System MUST display movie/TV show information including title, poster, rating, genre, year, and brief description, with option to click for more details
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle concurrent users at scale
- **FR-010**: Vote data MUST be retained indefinitely to maintain historical leaderboard integrity
- **FR-011**: System MUST load new content cards as quickly as possible using caching strategies for optimal performance
- **FR-012**: Categories MUST include genre-based categories and trending content (popular in the last 30 days)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Movie/TV Show**: Content item that users vote on, includes title, visual media, category classification, and aggregate vote score
- **Vote**: User action on content, captures vote value (+1/-1/0), timestamp, and session identifier
- **Leaderboard**: Ranked list of content based on aggregate votes, organized by category
- **Category**: Classification system for organizing movies and TV shows into browseable groups
- **User Session**: Anonymous identifier to track voting activity within a browser session
